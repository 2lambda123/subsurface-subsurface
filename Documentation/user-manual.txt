Subsurface 1.2

User Manual

Version 0.0.7

Autor documentation: Jacco van Koll <jko@haringstad.com>

Scope of this document is the usage of the program.
Please read the build manual for instructions how to build the
software and (if needed) its dependencies.

Audience: Fun Divers, Tec Divers, Professional Divers


1. Introduction:

Subsurface was started because of a lack of viable dive log software
on Linux. It turns out that the resulting software was easily ported
to Windows and Mac, but it clearly is a native Linux program first.
Right now, the program is under development and from version 1.1 it is
already very usable for divers with supported dive-computers.

In this manual the Suunto Viper will be used for all examples.


2. Requirements

Before you are able to import information from your divecomputer into
Subsurface, you need some preparation. Do you have the following:

	1. Your Divecomputer - Compatible with libdivecomputer (see list in Appendix A)
	2. Communication interface - Cable to connect your divecomputer to your PC/Laptop/Netbook
	3. Working installation of Subsurface
	4. If needed, the manual of your divecomputer


3. Start using the program:

When you start the program for the first time, it shows no information
at all. This is because the program does not automatically load the
already available dive-log files.

There is a menu, containing 'File', 'Log', 'Filter' and Help.

The screen is devided in 3 area's:

	Area with 3 tabs: Dive Notes, Equipment, Info & Stats
	Area next to the 3 tabs, which will contain the dive profile
	Area with the dives (usually called dive list), which can be sorted by number, date, etc.


4. Import new dives from your divecomputer

Before you start fiddeling around with your divecomputer, note that
there are divecomputers that consume more power when they are in the
PC-Communication mode. This could drain your battery. Therefor, ensure
if your computer is recharging when connecting to the USB port. The
Suunto Viper does not recharge trough the USB connection. Please
consult the manual of your divecomputer if you are unsure if it will
be recharged when connected to the USB port.

Now it is time to hook up your divecomputer to your Linux system:

    Make sure that your OS has the required drivers installed

	 On Linux this means you need to have the correct kernel
	 module loaded. Most distributions will do this automatically
	 for you.

	 On Windows, the OS should offer to download the correct
	 driver when you connect to the USB port.

	 On a Mac you at times have to manually hunt for the correct
	 driver. For example the correct driver for the Mares Puck
	 devices can be found as Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip at
	 http://www.silabs.com/support/pages/support.aspx?ProductFamily=USB+Bridges

    Connect your interface cable to a free USB port

    Put your divecomputer into PC Communication mode. (For Suunto Viper, press Mode - 1 Memory - 3 TR-PC)
	(You should consult the manual of your specific divecomputer for your brand and type)

    Go in Subsurface to 'File - Import'
	Within the popup, under Dive computer, choose your brand and type. Here we choose Suunto Vyper.
	Change the devicename under which your interface is connected.
	       On Linux, default is /dev/ttyUSB0
	       On Windows, default is COM3
	       On Mac, default is ... specific to the dive computer

	Click the 'OK' button.

    Now watch how your data is retrieved from your divecomputer!
    Depending on your type of computer and/or number of dives, this
    could take some time. Please be patient.


5. Viewing and completing your logs

When all data from your divecomputer is transferred, you will see a
listing of your dives in Area 3.

An example:

On Sunday Oct 23, 2011 you made a dive.
In the log line of this dive, you see the following information:

    #: 		12				Dive number
    Date:	Sun, Oct 23, 2011 10:50		Date and time of your dive
    *:						Your rating (none at this time)
    m:		12.8				Your maximum depth in meters
    min:	31:20				Your dive-time in minutes and seconds
    Deg. C:	13.0				Lowest water temperature during your dive
    Cyl:					Your used cylinder (none at this time)
    O2%:	air				What type of mixture
    SAC:					SAC (none at this time)
    Location:					Where you performed your dive (empty)

    As you can see, some information is already there because it is
    retrieved from your divecomputer. Some information is waiting for
    you to be added. By double clicking on this dive, you can view and
    complete the log.


6. Edit the dive info

When you double click on the dive log line, the editor window
opens. Now you can add information that is missing. Let start with
completing the example:

You double clicked on dive #12, as described in 5. Viewing and
completing your logs.  The Dive Info window pops up and you will see
the following:

    Location:	 An input where you can enter your new location, or you can choose with the pull-down previous locations
    Dive Master: An input where you can enter the name of your Dive Master, or you can choose with the pull-down a previous name
    Buddy:	 An input where you can enter het name of you Buddy, or you can choose with the pull-down a previous name
    Rating:	 A pull-down where you can rate your dive.
    Notes:	 A free input where you can enter information about your dive. What you've seen, etc.

In this example we use the following information:

    Location:	 	Oostvoornse Meer
    Dive Master:	S. de Vries
    Buddy:		S. de Vries
    Rating:		3 stars
    Notes:		First dive here. Good visibility. Did see the concrete poles, some crab and fish. Very nice and easy dive.
                        Made movie with 'headcam'.

Now don't press ok yet!


7. Edit equipment info

You also want to edit your Cylinder information. And in the previous
chapter, this was not edited. There is still another item to edit in
the Dive Info screen:

    Cylinder:	 A double-click fieldset. Here you can edit your Cylinder information

So, when you double click on the cylinder info, you get another
popup. This popup gives you the following:

    Cylinder: 	Pull-down where you can choose your Cylinder, or add your own
    Size:	The volume if not 'filled'
    Pressure:	The maximum pressure of this Cylinder
    Optional:
		Start Pressure: What was the pressure starting the dive
		End Pressure:	What was the pressure ending the dive
		Nitrox:		What was the percentage of blend

Now we are going to enter the data:

    Cylinder:	15.0 l
    Size:	15.0
    Pressure:	220

    Now tick the option for Start & End pressure

    Start Pressure:	180
    End Pressure:	60
    Press Ok

Now your dive information for this dive is complete. You can now press
ok in the Dive Info screen and view the results.


8. Adding equipment info

In Area with the 3 tabs there is the tab Equipment. With this tab, you
can add Cylinders.  We are going to add an additional Cylinder:

	In the main screen, click on the Equipment tab. This shows your Cylinder you added in 7.
	Now press the Add button and the Cylinder popup comes back.
	Just like you added your Cylinder information in 7. Edit equipment info, you add your cylinder
	information for the second Cylinder. Fill in all the information about this Cylinder and press OK.


9. View info & Stats

After adding all the information, you can use the tab Info &
Stats. This tab will provide you with all the (statistical and
calculated) information regarding your dive.

The information contains:

   Dive Info:

	Date:		Date and time of your dive
	Dive Time:	Duration of your dive
	Surf Intv:	Interval between previous dive and this dive
	Max Depth:	Maximum depth of this dive
	Avg Depth:	The average depth of this dive
	Water Temp:	Lowest temperature of the water
	SAC:		The amount of Surface Air Consumption liters per minute
	OTU:		The Oxygen Toxicity Units of this dive
	O2/He:		Amount of Oxygen/Helium
	Gas Used:	The total volume of gas used during this dive

   Statistics:

	Total time:	Total time of all your dives together, calculated
	Avg Time:	The average divetime of your dives, calculated
	Max Depth:	The maximum depth of all your dives
	Avg Depth:	The average depth of all your dives, calculated
	Max SAC:	Highest of Surface Air Consumption of all your dives
	Min SAC:	Lowest of Surface Air Consumption of all your dives
	Avg SAC:	Average Surface Air Consuption of all your dives, calculated


10. Setting up preferences

Subsurface has the ability to modify the preferences you want. By
using menu 'File - Preferences' you will be presented a popup with the
'Units'. You are free to choose what is your preference, with other
words, use Metric or Imperial.

You can set the following options:
	Depth:		Your diving depth in Meters or Feet
	Pressure:	The pressure of your tank(s) in Bar/Ato or PSI (Pressure Square Inch)
	Volume:		The volume of your tank(s) in Liter or CuFt (Cubic Feet) (At sea-level pressure)
	Temperature:	The temperature of the water in Celcius or Fahrenheit

In the main screen, you did see in Area 3, some information. In the
Columns options, you can enable/disable options you would like to show
there:
	Show Temp:	Shows the temperature of your dive
	Show Cyl:	Shows the cylinder(s) of your dive
	Show O2%:	Shows the O2% of your dive
	Show SAC:	Shows the SAC of your dive (Surface Air Consumption)
	Show OTU:	Shows the OTU of your dive (Oxygen Toxicity Units)

And, you can change the font usage of the program.

I will give an example here:

I am a diver in The Netherlands, using the Metric System. Therefor, I
go to the menu File, choose Preferences here. In the Units section, I
use the folowing:

	Depth:		Meter
	Pressure:	Bar
	Volume:		Liter
	Temperature:	Celcius

I would like to see the:
			Temperature
			Show Cyl
			Show O2%
			Show SAC

As a beginning diver, I don't need to track my OTUs. So I leave this
one not enabled.

Clicking OK on the dialog stores these settings.


11. How to find the Device Name

When you connect your divecomputer by using an USB connector, most of the
time, the default of '/dev/ttyUSB0' should work. But if you have other
Serial to USB devices, this can be different because '/dev/ttyUSB0' is
already in use.

One of the ways to find out what your dive name is:

	Disconnect your usb cable of your dive computer
	Open a terminal
	Type the command: 'dmesg' and press enter
	Plug in your usb cable of your divecomputer
	Type the command: 'dmesg' and press enter

Within your terminal you should see a message similair to this one:

	usb 2-1.1: new full speed USB device number 14 using ehci_hcd
	usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial
	USB Serial support registered for generic
	usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial_generic
	usbserial: USB Serial Driver core
	USB Serial support registered for FTDI USB Serial Device
	ftdi_sio 2-1.1:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
	usb 2-1.1: Detected FT232BM
	usb 2-1.1: Number of endpoints 2
	usb 2-1.1: Endpoint 1 MaxPacketSize 64
	usb 2-1.1: Endpoint 2 MaxPacketSize 64
	usb 2-1.1: Setting MaxPacketSize 64
	usb 2-1.1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB3
	usbcore: registered new interface driver ftdi_sio
	ftdi_sio: v1.6.0:USB FTDI Serial Converters Driver

You see that in the third line from the bottom, the usb adapter is
detected and is connected to 'ttyUSB3'. Now you use this information in
the import settings as '/dev/ttyUSB3'. Your divecomputer interface is
connected and you should be able to import your dives.


12. Importing dives from JDivelog

Maybe you have been using JDivelog and you have a lot of dives logged in
this program. You don't have to type all information by hand into
Subsurface, because you can import your divelogs from JDivelog.

JDivelog stores its information into files with the extention of .jlb.
These .jlb contain all the information that has been stored, except your
images in xml format.

By using the menu 'File - Import' you get the popup, like described in
chapter 4, Importing new dives. Within this popup there is the option
to import existing files which are already on your computer. To import
your JDivelog file(s) do the following:

	Open 'File - Import' on the menu
	Use the file locator under XML file name
	Browse your directories to the location where your *.jlb file is
	Select your existing *.jlb file and click 'open'
	Click the OK button in the popup

After a few moments, you see your existing logs in Subsurface. Now you can
edit your dives like explained in chapter 6.

Information that is imported from JDivelog into the location field:

	Extended dive location information

Information that is merged into the location or notes field:

	Used amount of weight
	Used type of suit
	Used type of gloves
	Type of dive
	Dive activity

Alternatively, you can start subsurface with the --import comand line
which will have the same effect:

      subsurface MyDives.xml --import JDivelogDives.jlb

will open your divelog (assuming that's called MyDives.xml) and then
import the dives from JdivelogDives.jlb. You can now save the combined
divelog back as MyDives.xml.

Subsurface will similarly import xml exports from DivingLog as well as
Suunto DiveManager.

When importing dives subsurface tries to detect multiple records for
the same dive and merges the information as best as it can. So as long
as there are no time zone issues (or other reasons that would cause the
beginning time of the dives to be substantially different) subsurface
will not create duplicate entries.


13. Importing dives from Suunto Divemanager 3.*

Before you can start importing dives from Suunto Divemanager, you first
have to export the dives you want to import. Subsurface does not import
directly from the Suunto Divemanager log files. The following procedures
unpacking instructions for Linux and Windows.

13.1 Export from Suunto Divemanager:

	Start Suunto Divemanager and login with the name containing the logs
	Do not start the import wizard to import dives from your computer.
	In the navigation tree on the left side of the program-window, select your dives.
	Within the list of dives, select the dives you would like to import later:
		To select certain dives: hold ctrl and point & click the dive
		To select all dives:  Select the first dive, hold down shift and select the last dive
	With the dives marked, use the program menu 'File - Export'
	The export popup will show
	Within this popup, there is one field called Export Path.
		Click the button browse next to the field Export Path
			A file-manager like window pops up
			Navigate to the directory where you want to store the Divelog.SDE file
			Optional change the name of the file you want to save
			Click 'Save'
		You are back in the Export popup. Press the button 'Export'
	Your dives are now exported to the file Divelogs.SDE.

13.2 Unpacking the Divelogs.SDE on Windows

Renaming your file to a .zip:

	Use the filemanager (explorer) and navigate to your Divelogs.SDE file
	Right click on the Divelogs.SDE file and choose 'Rename'
		Change the name into Divelogs.SDE.zip
		Press enter when done. A warning popup shows:
			The file could be unusable when changing the extension. Are you sure:
			Press OK.
	Your filemanager will show now the filename Divelogs.SDE.zip

When you double click your Divelogs.SDE.zip file, your preferred archiving
tool will start and show you the list of xml files that are in the zip
archive. Select all the xml files and extract them to a place where you
can find them later in the process.

13.3 Unpacking the Divelogs.SDE on Linux

The assumption is that you have exported your Divelogs.SDE on a Windows
system. You have to transfer the file to a location where you can read it
from within your Linux environment. You can use file-tranfer, shared
storage or an USB storage device to do this.
The example uses an USB storage:

	Insert your USB storage into your Windows computer
	Use the filemanager (explorer) to navigate to the location where your Divelogs.SDE file is located
	Copy the file to your USB storage:
		Select the file by 1 click
		Press Ctrl+c
		Navigate to your USB Storage
		Press Ctrl+v
	Disconnect your USB storage by right clicking your USB storage in the explorer and choose Eject
	Insert your USB storage into your Linux computer
	Use your favourite filemanager to navigate to your USB storage
	Copy the file to /tmp by:
		Right click on the file
		select copy
		navigate to /tmp
		press Ctrl+v or use the menu 'Edit - Paste'
	The file is now transfered to /tmp

Now the file is in /tmp, we can extract the xml files from it. You can do
this by hand, or use the example script in Appendix B.

To extract the xml files, we need to open a terminal and use the following
commands:

	cd /tmp
	mkdir suunto
	cd suunto
	unzip ../Divelogs.SDE

Your divelogs have now been extracted from the Divelogs.SDE file and you
can import them with the command:

	subsurface *.xml

And with the menu 'File - Save' you can save your dives into the
Subsurface format.


14. The menu and sub-menus

Within Subsurface, there are several menu and sub-menu options. All of
those will be described here with their function.

14.1 The file menu

The file menu is used for the following menu options:

	Open:		Open your saved Subsurface xml file(s)
	Save:		Save your current divelogs or changes you made to your divelogs
	Print:		Print your current divelog profiles and information about the dive
	Import:		Import your dives from your divecomputer, JDivelogs or Suunto Divemanager
	Preferences:	Set your preferences as described in chapter 10
	Quit:		Quit the program

14.2 The Log menu

Within the Log menu, there are only 2 sub-items:

	Renumber:	This option provides you with a popup. Within this
			popup you can choose what the first number of your dives should be
			for this set of dives.
	View:		This is a submenu containing:
		List:		Show only the list of dives you have made
		Profile:	Show only the dive profile of the selected dive
		Info:		Show only the 3 tab information screen
		Three:		Show the 'default' 3 screen setup

14.3 The Filter menu

This menu gives you the choice to enable or disable Events for the
selected divelog(s). At this time, you can enable or disable ascent.
When you enable ascent for your dives, within the dive profile, a yellow
marker with exclamation sign (!) will show on the points where you have
ascented.

14.4 The Help menu

The Help menu shows only the About, which contains the version and author
information and License button.
