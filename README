Half-arsed divelog software in C.

I'm tired of java programs that don't work etc.

You need libxml2-devel, gtk2-devel and GConf2-devel to build this.

You also need to have libdivecomputer installed, which goes something like this:

	git clone git://libdivecomputer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer
	cd libdivecomputer
	autoreconf --install
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Usage:

	make
	./subsurface dives/*.xml

to see my dives (with no notes or commentary).

Or, if you have a dive computer supported by libdivecomputer (and
connected to /dev/ttyUSB0), you can just do

	make
	./subsurface

and select "Import" from the File menu, tell it what dive computer you
have, and hit "OK".

There's a lot of duplicates in the XML files that come as an example,
and subsurface will de-duplicate the ones that are exactly the same
(just because they were imported multiple times).  But at least two of
the dives have duplicates that were edited by Dirk in the Suunto Dive
Manager, so they don't trigger the "exact duplicates" match.

Implementation details:

main.c - program frame
dive.c - creates and maintaines the internal dive list structure
libdivecomputer.c 
uemis.c 
parse-xml.c 
save-xml.c - interface with dive computers and the XML files 
profile.c - creates the data for the profile and draws it using cairo

A first UI has been implemented in gtk and an attempt has been made to
separate program logic from UI implementation. 

gtk-gui.c - overall layout, main window of the UI
divelist.c  - list of dives subsurface maintains
equipment.c - equipment / tank information for each dive
info.c      - detailed dive info 
print.c     - printing 

WARNING! I wasn't kidding when I said that I've done this by reading
gtk2 tutorials as I've gone along.  If somebody is more comfortable with
gtk, feel free to send me (signed-off) patches.

Just as an example of the extreme hackiness of the code, I don't even
bother connecting a signal for the "somebody edited the dive info"
cases.  I just save/restore the dive info every single time you switch
dives.  Christ! That's truly lame.

Also, I don't actually integrate directly with libdivecomputer, I just
read the XML files it can spit out.  But I included my own raw dive
profile xml files for anybody who isn't a diver, but decides that they
want to educate me in gtk.

NOTE! Some of the dives are pretty pitiful.  All the last dives are from
my divemaster course, so they are from following open water students
along (many of them the confined*water dives).  There a lot of the
action is at the surface, so some of the "dives" are 4ft deep and 2min
long.

Contributing:

Please either send me signed-off patches or a pull request with
signed-off commits.  If you don't sign off on them, I will not accept
them. This means adding a line that says "Signed-off-by: Name <email>"
at the end of each commit, indicating that you wrote the code and have
the right to pass it on as an open source patch.

See: http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	header line: explaining the commit in one line

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragrahps, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation.
